Hyperloop is a new way of transmitting information over a network. The connection between the two nearest nodes 
should have a very fast response and execution. Packets traveling through the network should have their own flag 
and each packet will be encapsulated and delivered to the nearest node. Synchronization in Hyperloop is a priority 
and every transport must be fast and expeditious. Iterations of the synchronous method will be repeated if the 
packet breaks during encapsulation or during sending or receiving. The flag will be a label and each node will be 
mapped to train and learn the network itself. Hyperloop should have an infinite iteration of synchronization that 
alternately routes layers.
